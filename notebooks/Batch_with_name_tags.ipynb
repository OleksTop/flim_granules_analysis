    "## Example of Batch Processing Using Folder Name with Variable Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to batch process images using folder name as multiple variable tags. Each folder represents a different set of experimental conditions, and these conditions are extracted from the folder name as variables.Each variable intended to be represented a value in the specified column in the resulting output table. This variables in the name of the folder are delineated by underscores (`_`). The script then used the function to processes paired images within the folder and aggregates the results into master DataFrames, which are then saved as CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup Output Directories**:\n",
    "    - The script first sets up directories for storing the output data. It creates an `Outputs` folder and a subfolder `Output_images` to store the results and images respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n",
    "    - Master DataFrames (`master_results` and `master_reports`) and other necessary data structures are initialized to collect the results from each processed folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Over Folders**:\n",
    "    - The script iterates over each subfolder in the `global_path` directory. Each subfolder represents a different date of experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Process Each Subfolder**:\n",
    "    - For each subfolder (representing a specific experiment), it extracts variables (such as cells, treatment, concentration) from the folder name. These variables are expected to be separated by underscores (`_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Process Paired Images**:\n",
    "    - The function `in_folder_loop` is called to process the images within each subfolder. It uses the selected analysis function to generate results and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Assign Identifiers**:\n",
    "    - The extracted variables (cells, treatment, concentration, date) and the name of the selected analysis function are added as columns to the results and reports DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
